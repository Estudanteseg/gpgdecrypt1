# decrypt gpg
 Share with everyone, some codes that I do to learn how to work with security information.
 
 decgpg.sh -> Decrypt gpg file using brute force. Eg. ./decgpg myfile.gpg myfileout.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
 decgpgv2.sh -> Decrypt gpg file using brute force (array). Eg. ./decgpg myfile.gpg myfileout.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou_parte1.txt
